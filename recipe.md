Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Place cupcake liners in 8 wells of a muffin tin.

In a small bowl,whisk together the coconut flour,cocoa powder,salt,baking soda,and powdered buttermilk,if using.Set aside.


In a larger bowl,combine the eggs,egg whites.Mix buttermilk or water,erythritol,and stevia.Mix on low speed with a hand blender until combined.Add the dry indgredients and mix well,begining on low speed and increasing to high,for about 2 minutes,until well-blended and no lumps remain.Blend in food coloring until desired colour is achieved.


Divide batter evenly among the cupcake liners.Bake for 20 minutes,or until a toothpick inserted in center of a cupcake comes out clean.Cool completely before frosting.




To make a frosting,beat together the cream cheese and Melt until fluffy(the Melt does not need to be warmed to room temperature;it will be soft enough straight from refrigerator).Add the powdered erythritol in several additions,beating well, until fluffy.Beat in liquid vanilla stevia drops to taste.
